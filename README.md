# Zetect

Zetect is an experimental email security assistant that integrates with **Microsoft Outlook (via Microsoft Graph API)** and **OpenAI** to help detect and analyze suspicious emails.  

It connects to your Outlook inbox, fetches emails, and uses GPT to classify or comment on them.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** For security reasons, no API keys or cached credentials are included in this repository. To run Zetect, you must set up your own **Azure App registration** and provide your own **OpenAI API key**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Zetect.git
cd Zetect
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root (e.g. zetect.env) with the following keys:

env
Copy code
# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Microsoft Graph (from your Azure App registration)
CLIENT_ID=your_azure_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_azure_client_secret
TENANT_ID=your_azure_tenant_id
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000
4. Azure App Setup
Go to the Azure Portal.

Register a new App Registration.

Configure API Permissions ‚Üí add Mail.Read.

Generate a Client Secret.

Copy the Client ID, Tenant ID, and Client Secret into your .env.

Set a redirect URI (e.g., http://localhost:8000).

üöÄ Usage
Authenticate
The first time you run Zetect, authenticate with Microsoft Graph:

bash
Copy code
zetect auth
You‚Äôll be redirected to a browser window to log in to your Microsoft account.

If successful, the terminal will confirm with:

zetect classify inbox
(Or replace classify with your own custom action.)

üîí Notes
Each user must provide their own OpenAI key and Azure credentials.

This project does not include cached tokens or authentication files.

For security, never commit your .env file to GitHub.

üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap

This is **100% Markdown-formatted** ‚Äî headers, lists, code blocks, notes, and sections will all render properly on GitHub.  

Do you also want me to add a **Mermaid diagram** (GitHub supports them) that shows the flow: *Inbox ‚Üí Zetect ‚Üí GPT ‚Üí Output*? That could make the README even cleaner.
